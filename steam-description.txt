What this mod does:
1. All major and minor settlements start at max tier.
2. They always remain at max tier after occupation, same for occupy ruin.
3. Ogre camp, Black Ark, Chaos Horde now cost 0 food, 0 resource, and 1 turn to level up the main chain.
4. MCT support to customize settlement levels.


Compatibility
This simple mod should be compatible with everything, no matter it is tier-4 minor settlements, more slots, or whatever. Safe to add or remove mid-campaign. Shall always work regardless of game update.

Some mods, such as sigmar's heir and mixu minor factions, set certain settlements at lower level in their scripts. Raze and re-occupy will set them to max level.


MCT (Mod Configuration Tool) customizations
- Enable or disable the mod.
- Change starting major settlement level (1-5).
- Choose if minor settlements need to be effective, if so you can set them to any level (1-3).
- Choose if after occupation the settlement level wil return to the set level.


Campaign Balance
Campaign will have less micro-manage and more intense from early on.

It is easier on low difficulty level, but more difficulty on very hard or legendary because AI will build tier-3 units early on. Certain factions will quickly snowball to very powerful by turn 50 (especially if you use dynamic AI or stronger AI)


Misc:
In case you would like to leave me a Tip[www.paypal.com] for this work.
